- **Gradient Buttons**: Primary actions with hover animations
- **Interactive Controls**: Custom styled form elements
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time feedback with animations

## 📱 Usage

### Initial Setup
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Grant camera permission when prompted
3. Select crop area for text recognition
4. Configure TTS settings as needed

### Text Recognition
1. Click "Start Monitoring" to begin real-time OCR
2. Point camera at text you want to read
3. Adjust crop area to focus on specific regions
4. Use "Read Now" for manual text capture

### Settings
- **Auto Read**: Toggle automatic speech synthesis
- **Reading Delay**: Adjust processing frequency (500ms - 5s)
- **OCR Sensitivity**: Confidence threshold for text detection
- **Speech Rate**: TTS speed control (0.5x - 2.0x)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All OCR and TTS happens in your browser
- **No Data Upload**: Text and images never leave your device
- **Secure Context**: Requires HTTPS for camera access (localhost exception)
- **Permission Based**: Explicit user consent for camera access
- **Storage Control**: Settings stored locally, user controlled

## 🌟 Browser Compatibility

### Fully Supported
- **Chrome/Edge**: 88+ (full MediaDevices and Web Speech API)
- **Firefox**: 85+ (full feature support)
- **Safari**: 14+ (iOS 14.3+, some limitations on mobile)

### Required Features
- **WebAssembly**: For Tesseract.js OCR processing
- **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript features
- **MediaDevices API**: Camera access and constraints
- **Web Speech API**: Text-to-speech synthesis
- **Canvas API**: Image processing and cropping

## 🚀 Getting Started

The app is currently running on **http://localhost:3000** with a Python HTTP server.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Server is already running in background
curl http://localhost:3000  # Test connectivity
```

### Development
```bash  
# For future development with full build system:
npm run dev     # Vite dev server (when platform issues resolved)
npm run build   # Production build
npm run preview # Preview production build
```

### Testing
```bash
node test.js    # Run basic connectivity tests
# Playwright tests available when platform supports it
```

## 📋 Current Status

✅ **Server Running**: Python HTTP server on port 3000  
✅ **Modern UI**: Dark theme with glass morphism effects  
✅ **Web APIs**: Camera, OCR, TTS integration complete  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with desktop enhancements  
✅ **Persistence**: Settings and crop areas saved locally  
⚠️ **Testing**: Basic tests only (Playwright unsupported on Android)
