# CaptnReverse Web App Status

## Current Issues & Solutions

### Camera Permission Problem ⚠️
**Issue**: Browser doesn't ask for camera permission
**Cause**: Modern browsers require HTTPS for camera access (except localhost/127.0.0.1)
**Solution**: Access via secure context

### Working URLs:
- ✅ http://127.0.0.1:3000 (loopback interface - should work)
- ✅ http://localhost:3000 (if properly configured)
- ❌ http://[external-ip]:3000 (requires HTTPS)

## Completed Features

### ✅ Core Functionality
- Modern dark UI with glass morphism effects
- Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- MediaDevices API integration for camera access
- Tesseract.js v5.1.1 OCR engine with WebAssembly
- Web Speech API for text-to-speech
- Interactive crop area selection
- Real-time monitoring with configurable settings

### ✅ Enhanced Features
- Camera zoom controls (1x-5x zoom)
- Visual crop overlay on camera preview with canvas rendering
- Improved TTS with voice selection and error handling
- Test TTS button for immediate verification
- Enhanced OCR logging with confidence metrics
- Smart text filtering (minimum length, duplicate prevention)
- Live reload functionality for development

### ✅ Technical Improvements
- Git repository with conventional commits
- Proper error handling for camera access failures
- Secure context checking for HTTPS requirements
- MediaStream track management for zoom control
- Canvas-based crop visualization
- Comprehensive debugging and logging

## Current Status

**Server**: Running on port 3000 with live reload
**Watch Mode**: Active - file changes trigger browser refresh
**Git Repository**: Initialized with proper commit history

### Next Steps for User

1. **Access via localhost**: Use http://127.0.0.1:3000 or http://localhost:3000
2. **Grant Permission**: Click "Enable Camera Access" and allow in browser prompt
3. **Test TTS**: Use "Test TTS" button to verify speech synthesis
4. **Setup Crop**: Configure text recognition area
5. **Start Monitoring**: Begin real-time OCR processing

### For Production Deployment

1. **HTTPS Hosting**: Deploy to secure hosting for full camera API access
2. **SSL Certificate**: Enable HTTPS for external access
3. **PWA Features**: Add manifest for app-like experience
4. **Service Worker**: Enable offline functionality

## Architecture

**Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS with modern APIs
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom dark theme
**OCR**: Client-side Tesseract.js processing
**TTS**: Native Web Speech API
**Server**: Simple Python HTTP server for development

**Privacy**: All processing happens locally in browser - no data upload**
